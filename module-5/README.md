# Module 5: Monitoring and Logging

This module covers monitoring and logging for applications deployed on Azure using Application Insights.

## Topics Covered

- Creating an Application Insights resource
- Enabling Application Insights for services
- Browsing the application and adding products to the shopping cart
- Checking various metrics in Application Insights
- Implementing changes in the code to add custom events and metrics
- Examining logs and custom events in Application Insights
- Using Kusto queries to filter logs
- Introducing an error in the code and examining the error in Application Insights

## Practical Task

The practical task involved creating an Application Insights resource, enabling Application Insights for the PetStore services, browsing the PetStore website, checking various metrics in Application Insights, implementing changes in the code to add custom events and metrics, examining logs and custom events in Application Insights, using Kusto queries to filter logs, introducing an error in the code, and examining the error in Application Insights.

## Commands Used

A variety of Azure CLI and Az PowerShell commands were used to accomplish the task, including `az monitor app-insights component create`, `az webapp config appsettings set`, `az webapp config container set`, and `az monitor app-insights events show`.

## Learnings

Through this module, I learned how to create an Application Insights resource, enable Application Insights for services, check various metrics in Application Insights, add custom events and metrics to the code, examine logs and custom events in Application Insights, use Kusto queries to filter logs, introduce an error in the code, and examine the error in Application Insights. I also gained hands-on experience with Azure CLI, Az PowerShell, and Application Insights.
